## day 1 (9/1/2019)

Today I started making my shaded world map with the Nobel prize data. I soon realised that a lot of the country
names in the Nobel prize dataset didn't accord with country names in the world map dataset, because of
changes in names over the years (1900 till now).
So I had to manually change many of these names.

Another problem is the fact that the Nobel prize dataset has a column for which country the winner(s) "belong to",
but in many cases this column has the value 'null'.
Which is why I decided to see the country of birth as the country the Nobel prize belongs to.

Progress: my world map is now shaded and my dataset is complete and correct.

## day 2 (10/1/2019)

Today I wanted to make the different pages for my project, connect them and start with the pie chart.
I succeeded making the pages and connecting them and making the pie chart. I haven't succeeded being able to update
the pie chart by clicking on a country yet.

Progress: the website has three different pages and a pie chart.

## day 3 (11/1/2019)

Absent.

## day 4 (14/1/2019)

Today I encountered some problems with updating my donut chart, because of the different parts (arc & pie). But fortunately I managed to in the end. However, the tooltip that I used (d3-tip) didn't update with the data.

Progress: the donut chart updates when a country is clicked, a legend was added.
