      Description of visualization

      The first graph you see is an interactive world map, which shows the amount of Nobel prize winners per country.
      To calculate these amounts the country of birth of the Nobel prize winner was seen
      as the country the Nobel prize 'belongs to'.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can switch between 'Total Nobel Prizes' and 'Nobel Prizes per Capita' by clicking on the buttons. The population used to calculate
      the amount of Nobel Prizes per capita is taken from the year 2015, because .... HAVE TO ADD A REASON!

      “Gross” enrollment includes students of all ages. In other words, it includes students whose age exceeds the official age group (e.g. repeaters). Thus, if there is late enrollment, early enrollment, or repetition, the total enrollment can exceed the population of the age group that officially corresponds to the level of education – leading to ratios greater than 100 percent

“Net” enrollment includes only children of the official school age, as defined by the national education system. Small discrepancies in the reported age of children may occasionally cause net enrollment rates to exceed 100 percent.

Since the net enrollment rate excludes overage and underage students, it more accurately captures education system’s coverage and internal efficiency than gross enrollment ratio. However, it is useful to see differences between the gross enrollment ratio and the net enrollment rate for capturing the incidence of overage and underage enrollments

      The second graph you see is a pie chart, which shows the amount of Nobel prize winners per
      category. When a certain country in the world map is clicked, this chart will update to show the Nobel prizes
      for that specific country.
